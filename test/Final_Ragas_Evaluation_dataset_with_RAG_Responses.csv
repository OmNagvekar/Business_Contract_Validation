limitations or carve-outs.

6.2 Non-Compete:
Previous Response: No, the clause does not fully adhere to standards. Rationale: The leave policy violates labor laws by providing zero paid leave and allowing termination for any absence. The holiday policy allows arbitrary declaration of holidays, potentially not adhering to statutory holiday requirements. The confidentiality clause is overly broad, with indefinite secrecy and no carve-outs for legally required disclosures.

For Jane Smith:
Jane Smith",FALSE,"Answer: No, the clause does not fully adhere to standards. Rationale: The clause does not specify which standards are being adhered to, and the agreement appears to be biased towards the employer.
",No : This clause appears to conform with general employment contract requirements.,FALSE,"system: Project Description: This project automates business contract validation by ensuring that contracts meet predefined standards. The system classifies input contracts and compares them against standard templates (including key provisions from the Indian Contract Law and the Indian Contract Act) to detect any deviations. Each clause must be evaluated for compliance with these legal standards. 
user: Example Evaluation: For example, consider the clause: 'The contractor shall maintain confidentiality for 3 years after termination.' If the standard requires a confidentiality period of at least 2 years, then the correct evaluation would be 'Yes', with a rationale such as: 'The clause meets the minimum confidentiality period required by the standards.'
system: History (for context only): Previous Clause:those laws.

10. Execution
Previous Response: Answer: No, the clause does not fully adhere to standards. Rationale: The employer's ability to unilaterally amend the agreement without the employee's consent, the biased interpretation favoring the employer, the voiding of the entire agreement upon finding a single clause invalid, and the non-waiver provision leading to arbitrary enforcement all raise concerns about fairness, equity, and adherence to established legal principles.

user: Now, please evaluate whether the following contract clause adheres to the above standards. Respond with 'Yes' or 'No' and provide a brief rationale.
Clause: unequal treatment.
