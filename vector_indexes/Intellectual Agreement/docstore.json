It is expressly agreed that a material breach of\r\nthis Agreement (except Section 14 (Confidentiality)) by a party could cause\r\nirreparable harm to the non-breaching party and that a remedy at law would be\r\ninadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all remedies available at law, the\r\nnon-breaching party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable\r\nremedies in all legal proceedings in the event of any threatened or actual\r\nviolation of any or all of the provisions hereof.\r\n\r\n18.7 Attorneys' Fees.

This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts,\r\neach of which shall be deemed an original, but both of which together shall\r\nconstitute one and the same instrument. If this Agreement is executed in\r\ncounterparts, no signatory hereto shall be bound until both the parties named\r\nbelow have duly executed or caused to be duly executed a counterpart of this\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n18.15 Entire Agreement.

Com21 will provide 3Com with a reasonable number of\r\nman-hours of Com21 R&D, manufacturing and quality assurance engineers for\r\nsupport by telephone, fax or if requested by 3Com, at 3Com Santa Clara site,\r\nprovided Com21's current timetable for commercialization is not adversely\r\nimpacted. Com21 and 3Com shall designate representatives to serve as contacts\r\nfor such support. If additional support is requested by 3Com, Com21 shall\r\nprovide, at Com21's sole discretion, such service at reasonable times and places\r\nand at a rate equal to Com21's then current standard fee therefor (currently\r\n[$150]/hour at Com21 facilities).
